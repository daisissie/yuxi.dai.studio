    <h1>About Yuxi Dai</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a designer passionate about the intersection of spatial thinking, computation, and technology. Currently, I am pursuing an MS in Computational Design Practice at Columbia University's GSAPP, where I am expanding my expertise by exploring advanced techniques and tools, such as Grasshopper, Python, Blender, GIS, and Revit, to push the boundaries of my design capabilities. My undergraduate studies at Syracuse University provided a strong foundation in architectural design, sharpening my skills in representation, modeling, communication, and design sensibility. Additionally, various internship experiences allowed me to gain hands-on knowledge with data visualization, construction drawings and on-site operations across diverse projects, including commercial, educational, residential, master planning, and renovations. I excel in effective communication and thrive both independently and within collaborative team settings.
